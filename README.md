# Mobile App UI/UX Design Skill

A comprehensive Claude Code skill for designing professional, polished mobile app interfaces that follow proven design principles from top-tier apps like Airbnb, Duolingo, Spotify, Revolut, and Phantom.

## Overview

This skill guides the creation of mobile app UIs that are intentional, smooth, personal, and alive — not just functional. It covers everything from design philosophy to implementation details.

## Features

- **Complete Design Process**: 5-step framework from context to polish
- **Industry-Specific Conventions**: Design patterns for 9+ industries (AI, Crypto, Finance, Health, etc.)
- **Emotional Design Principles**: Peak-End Rule, feedback loops, strategic patterns
- **Design Systems**: Typography, color (60/30/10 rule), spacing (8-point grid)
- **Implementation Guidance**: React, Tailwind CSS, component patterns

## When to Use

This skill automatically triggers when you ask Claude to:
- Design a mobile app screen
- Create app mockups
- Build mobile UI components
- Improve an existing mobile app design
- Create onboarding flows
- Design mobile navigation
- Build React Native/Flutter/SwiftUI interfaces

## Design Principles

### Core Philosophy
Great mobile UI isn't about flashiness — it's about intentionality. Every pixel, spacing value, and color choice should serve the user.

### Key Design Laws
- **60/30/10 Color Rule**: 60% neutral, 30% complementary, 10% accent
- **8-Point Grid System**: All spacing divisible by 8 or 4
- **Peak-End Rule**: Users remember peak moment + ending
- **Thumb Zone**: Primary actions in bottom 1/3 of screen
- **F-Pattern**: Natural reading/scanning order
- **Typography Hierarchy**: Max 4 sizes, 2 weights

## Examples

```
"Design a fitness app home screen"
"Create a banking app dashboard"
"Build a meditation app interface"
"Design a crypto wallet transaction screen"
"Create an onboarding flow for a health app"
```
